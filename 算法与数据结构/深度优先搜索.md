TOPOLOGICAL-SORT(G)
 call DFS(G) to compute finishing times v.f for each vertex v as each vertex is finished, insert it onto the front of a linked list
 return the linked list of vertices
```

```
STRONGLY-CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G)
	call DFS(G) to compute finishing times u.f for each vertex u
	compute G^T
	call DFS(G^T), but in the main loop of DFS, consider the vertices in order of decreasing u.f (as computed in line 1)
	output the vertices of each tree in the depth-first forest formed in line 3 as a seperate strongly connected component
